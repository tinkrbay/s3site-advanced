# Stocks!

A free, lightweight, blazing-fast static page to get stock quotes using the [IEX API](https://iextrading.com/developer/). Stocks can be grouped into user-defined portfolios. Quotes update every 10 seconds. No API key required. Everything is contained within index.html, there are no external javascripts or stylesheets to load.

See here for a live demo: https://toddwschneider.com/stocks/

## Motivation

I used to use Google Finance portfolios as a simple way to watch a few baskets of stocks organized along some dimension, typically by sector (banks, tech, etc). Then Google Finance [killed the portfolios feature](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!category-topic/websearch/uf8q-AaPiyQ), and the new version had no option to view stock quotes organized under subheaders with good information density. I tried [some alternatives](https://www.marketbeat.com/press-room/google-finance-changes-and-alternatives/), but many of them felt too bloated, so I built my own.

## Customize

Add portfolio names and symbols as query parameters in the URL. For example, if you wanted to see the collection of bank and tech stocks from the above screenshot, you could use this URL:

https://toddwschneider.com/stocks/?Banks=GS,MS,JPM&Tech=AAPL,GOOGL,MSFT,AMZN

Alternatively, you can edit the `DEFAULT_PORTFOLIOS` variable within `index.html`. For example:

```js
const DEFAULT_PORTFOLIOS = [
  {'name': 'Banks', 'symbols': ['GS', 'MS', 'JPM']},
  {'name': 'Tech', 'symbols': ['AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'MSFT', 'AMZN']}
];
```

## Host your own

If you fork this repo on GitHub and edit index.html to reflect the stocks you want to watch, then you can use a [GitHub Pages Project Page](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/) to publish your own version to the web.

You could also save index.html to your local disk and open it in your browser, or upload it to a cloud storage service like S3, GCS, or Azure Storage.

## IEX API

You do not need to sign up for anything or get an API key to use the [IEX API](https://iextrading.com/developer/docs/), but usage is subject to their [terms of service](https://iextrading.com/api-terms/).

## Why aren't the market indices available? (S&P 500, DJIA, NASDAQ)

The IEX API only provides free data for stocks, not indices, so the closest thing is to use ETFs that track the major indices. See here for context: https://github.com/iexg/IEX-API/issues/36. Suggested index ETFs:

- S&P 500: `SPY`
- Dow Jones: `DIA`
- NASDAQ: `QQQ`
- Russell 2000: `IWM`

## Browser compatibility

The page uses the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API), which means it does not work with Internet Explorer.
